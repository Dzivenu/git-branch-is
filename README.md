A Node.js/npm project template with codecov, coveralls, ESLint,
github\_changelog\_generator, istanbul, JSDoc, and mocha.

It is the template that I am using for my own Node.js projects, which
represents my current preferences.  I am not advocating for these choices nor
this template specifically, although I am happy to discuss or explain any
choices made herein.  It is being published both for my own convenience and
in case it may be useful to others with similar tastes.

## Introductory Example

```js

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and very much appreciated!  Please add tests to
cover any changes and ensure `npm test` passes.

If the desired change is large, complex, backwards-incompatible, can have
significantly differing implementations, or may not be in scope for this
project, opening an issue before writing the code can avoid frustration and
save a lot of time and effort.
